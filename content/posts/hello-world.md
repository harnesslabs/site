# Welcome to Harness Labs

Harness Labs exists to build novel software based around mathematics. 
We believe that mathematics is the foundation of all technology, and we are dedicated to using it to create software that is both powerful and beautiful.

## Our Mission

The mission is simple: 
1. Create a growing community of mathematicians, enjoyers of mathematics, and those who want to learn more about mathematics.
2. Use mathematics to power real-world applications.
3. Build an organization that serves as a hub for the community; a place where people want to work and learn.
